STEPS FOR PUSHING LOCAL BRANCH TO GITHUB:
1. Make sure you are in the branch where you have your local changes
2. Then, run "git pull origin main" to update your branch with the latest changes from the main branch
3. If there are any merge conflicts, resolve them BEFORE pushing your branch to GitHub
4. Once resolved, push to GitHub using "git push origin <branchname>"
5. If your branch is ready to be merged with the main branch, go to GitHub and click "Compare & Pull Request"
6. The pull-request will have to be approved by a team member
7. Once the merge is complete, it is good practice to delete the branch (but not strictly necessary). Use "git branch -d <branchname>" to delete the branch locally. The remote branch (the one on GitHub) can be deleted manually.

TO CREATE A NEW BRANCH:
1. Use the command "git checkout -b 'branchname'" to automatically create and visit the new branch (locally)
2. Use the command "git branch -a" to view all branches

COMMANDS FOR RUNNING THE SERVER:
1. Us the command "npm start" to run server and view it in a web-browser
2. To stop running the server use "Ctrl + C" (might be a different command depending on operating system)



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
